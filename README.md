<h1>Why I made my work :</h1>
<p>
  While learning and working as a freelancer I found myself keep track on my actual pure working time and the data I concluded every week proved to be very useful to me by : bing a measure of the efficiency of my work  by helping me estimate how much time specific work will take todo 
In general this working time tracking improve my efficiency and my general time management .
But there is a problem , tracking this data is hard and annoying in order of getting the wanted conclusion I needed to recalculate every dya/week data which is not real reasonable…
My app solves exactly that we will get an full image of our time efficiencyby click in alive updating framework to the most accurate data all the time.

<h1>Under the hood :</h1>

This 1.22 version of the app as for now Is fully KMP implemented but with native UI (in the feture will be converted to compose multiPlatform or native IOS UI will be added.)
<br>
<br>
My work 1.22 version is build with :
* MVVM and clean architecture build patterns 
* According to the repository pattern 
* digger hill for dependency injection (as for now should be solved for IOS…)
* Sql delight for our local db , easy to implement for both platforms  
* Compose UI and material 3 component’s
* Canvas and animatable for our UI interactive components 
* KotlinX dataTime to use time in multi platforms
